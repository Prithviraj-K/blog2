I'm Raj Khandekar. 

Join me as I document my journey through the OSCP certification and beyond.

Currently, I am working through the course content while completing the [TJ Null List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#) for proving grounds. The specific boxes are completed in my blog posts below.
